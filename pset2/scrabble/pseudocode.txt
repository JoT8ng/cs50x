// Compute and return score for string
Associate each char in the array of strings input by the users to the array of points
    Ensure that both upper and lowercase of the char is associated with the same point
Get the sum of that array of points
Boolean statement if not a char associate with 0 points


word1 = Dog

word1[0] = D	=	POINTS[3] = 2
word1[1] = o	=	POINTS[14] = 1
word1[2] = g	=	POINTS[6] = 2

sum1 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

ASCII a-z = 97-122
	-32 = lowercase to uppercase
	97 = 0
